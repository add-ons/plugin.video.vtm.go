# VTM GO Kodi add-on

**This add-on is currently under development and isn't ready for use yet. The [Release 1.0](https://github.com/michaelarnauts/plugin.video.vtm.go/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Release+1.0%22) milestone indicates what issues I think are blocking the general use of this add-on.**

*plugin.video.vtm.go* is a Kodi add-on for watching all live video streams and all video-on-demand content available on the VTM GO platform.
