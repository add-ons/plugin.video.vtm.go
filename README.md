# VTM GO Kodi add-on

**This add-on is currently under development and isn't ready for use yet. The [Release 1.0](https://github.com/michaelarnauts/plugin.video.vtm.go/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Release+1.0%22) milestone indicates what issues I think are blocking the general use of this add-on.**

*plugin.video.vtm.go* is a Kodi add-on for watching all live video streams and all video-on-demand content available on the VTM GO platform. 
This add-on will also play the ads that are added to the streams by VTM GO.

The following features are supported:
* Watch live TV (VTM, Q2, Vitaya, CAZ, VTM Kids, VTM Kids Jr & QMusic)
* Watch on-demand content (movies and series)
* Browse the VTM GO recommendations and "My List"
* Browse a TV Guide
* Search the catalogue
* Browse the Kids zone
* Watch YouTube content from some of the DPG Media channels
